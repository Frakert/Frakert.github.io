Welcome to my personal profile website. I made this to showcase some of my passion projects, professional experiences and other stuff I am working on.

Scientific Machine Learning for Physics. What does this mean?
======
I tend to have some issues explaining what I do and what I care about. This section is a small synopsis. \
I try to describe myself as a scientific machine learning engineer, to be specific in Physics. This means I try to apply AI to improve and empower research and the acedemic process. \

Physics was, and still is, a field driven by observation. Kepler, Ohm and Plancks laws were all fits to experimental data, not laws derived from first principles. AI and bigger compute allow us to take this a step further. Finding physical laws in many-dimensional data that no researcher could visualise is one of the many great promises big data processing offers. \

Ways that AI can empower physics is for example, but not limited to:
- Discovering ODEs/PDEs/equations from data
- Fast surrogate models to replace expensive simulations
- Physics-Informed Machine Learning, AI that learns more efficiently by embedding Physics into models
- Parameter estimation from data
- Discrepancy modeling to learn "residual" Physics
- Improve (measurement) resolution using ML techniques

I aim to expand research and applications in this direction. 

Other (Work/Research) Interests
=========
Though Physics-Informed Machine Learning holds my current interest, there are other related topics I also quite like.
These inlcude
- Bayesian Machine Learning & Active Learning
- Predictive Maintenance & Digital Twinning
- Reinforcment Learning

As you may notice, these all remain in the field of ML/Data Science or engineering.
